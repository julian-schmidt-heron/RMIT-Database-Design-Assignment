# Database Design and Optimisation Assignment ‚Äì RMIT Semester 2, 2024

I am Julian Schmidt-Heron, and am in my third year of my Bachelor of Data Science (Professional) degree at RMIT University.

This repository contains my submission for the "Database Design and Optimisation" assignment completed in Semester 2, 2024. The task involved designing a relational database from the ground up based on a real-world scenario, implementing it in SQL, and justifying design choices in a detailed written report.

The assignment was awarded **25/25 (full marks)** for demonstrating **perfect functionality**, meeting **all assignment specifications**, and showcasing a **strong understanding of relational database design principles and SQL skills**.
